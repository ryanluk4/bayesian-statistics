# Applied Bayesian Statistics (STAT 206)
STAT 206: Applied Bayesian Statistics [Draper - Winter 2020]

Most of the code is written and provided by Prof. David Draper, with some slight modification (as needed for quizzes and tests) and exploration by myself. I am putting all of this into a repo to organize R commands and statistics/data science techniques in one location.

I absolutely loved this class. Prof. Draper effectively communicates key statistics and data science principles, making them easy to digest, while also giving industry and research examples.
